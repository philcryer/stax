# Stax

## About

Create stacks (aka stax) on AWS ([Amazon Web Services](aws.amazon.com)) in a private VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with failover NAT nodes proxying network traffic to elastic [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/) clusters running Docker. Some of the ideas can be seen in this image.

## Requirements

### Client

* Stax runs on Linux (tested on Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu, others should work too) and Apple OS X (tested on 10.10 and 10.9).

### Curl

* Install [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) if you don't already have it installed (OS X has it by default, and most Linux distros have it by default) on your client.

```bash
apt-get install curl   # Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu
yum install curl       # Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux
```

### aws-cli

* Install [aws-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) (Universal Command Line Interface for Amazon Web Services) on your client.

```bash
apt-get install awscli  # Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu
brew install aws-cli    # Apple OS X ([via Homebrew](http://brew.sh/))
yum install awscli      # Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Amazon Linux
```

* Configure the aws client with your AWS credentials. Find yours from the [users page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#users) on the AWS Console. Choose your username, scroll down to Security Credentials > Access Credentials > Access Keys, and click Manage Access Keys.

```bash
aws configure
```

You will be prompted to enter your AWS access key and secret access key, and will write and store them in ~/.aws/credentials.

### AWS Key Pair

* Create a new Key Pair so aws-cli can talk to AWS. From the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home) navigate to EC2 > Netork & Security > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair
* Name it whatever you want, click 'Create'
* It will create a new Key Pair and automatically download it
* Move the new keypair into the .ssh directory in your home directory

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/NEW_KEY_PAIR.pem ~/.ssh
```

## Usage

* To get started, clone stax

```bash
git clone https://github.com/philcryer/stax
cd stax
```

* Copy the example config file

```bash
cp config/config.json.example config.json
```

* Configure the config file replacing all instances of [<changeMe]. Notice the cluster size option that defines the minimal amount of CoreOS nodes running, start with [2] for now.

```bash
vi config.json
```

* Run stax

```bash
$ stax
Usage: stax <command>

Commands:
  list          List all currently built and running stax
  create        Create a new VPC stax in AWS
  describe      Describe the created VPC stax
  connect       Connect to the jumpbox in the VPC stax over SSH
  destroy       Destroy the existing VPC stax
```

* Create a stax cluster on AWS

```bash
stax create
```

Watch for any errors.

## Accessing the cluster

* It will take ~5 minutes to build, you can check the status in the AWS console, or just try to connect with stax.

```bash
stax connect
```

The command will check if the cluster is built, and if it is, it will populate the jumpbox with needed information and then connect you to it.

* Once on the jumpbox you can get to randomly available CoreOS/Docker host with the dockconnect command.

```bash
dockconnect
```

* Once on a CoreOS/Docker host see if fleet can see the other Docker hosts.

```bash
fleetctl list-machines
```

* Example output
```bash
[ec2-user@ip-10-183-1-99 ~]$ dockconnect
CoreOS (alpha)
core@ip-10-183-2-219 ~ $
core@ip-10-183-2-219 ~ $ fleetctl list-machines
MACHINE   IP    METADATA
057d212e... 10.183.0.16 -
4f622c15... 10.183.2.219  -
```

Ta... da.

## Destroyng the cluster

* To delete the cluster, as well as the cloudformation scripts, security groups, etc that it created.

```bash
stax destroy
```

## Other details

* The stax configuration is handled by Cloud Formation scripts, see them in the templates directory.
* Services installed on CoreOS are etcd and fleet by default.
* Future plans call for use of an orchestrator to run Docker instances across the cluster using fleet (or something else).

## Stax Studio

* Stax, besides being a clever take on the word stacks, is named after the famous Stax Recording Studio in Memphis, TN. If you're ever in Memphis, visit the awesome [Stax Museum](http://www.staxmuseum.com/)... it's far more interesting than Sun Studios, but I digress.
